NN-basic:
why NN is used! :
	This is called generalisation. Highly complex pattern recognition can be achieved by using a network of neurons hence the name neural networks. 
	The networks normally used for pattern recognition are called feed forward because they have no feedback. They simply associate inputs with outputs.
why only sigmoid function is used for activation function():
	Sigmoid function is differentiable often used to introduce nonlinearity in the model
