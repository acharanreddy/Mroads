kernal in svm?
kernal types:
#Decision tree:A tree to specify consquences and decisions.
Each node is a test on a attribute
each branch is a result
each result is a class variable
numeric data is categarized based in the range.
 
>timecomplexity reduces on using this tree rather than graphs
>entropy:uncertanity in the data,then go with voting process
>like making the entropy caculated and comparing with the actual values
>C4.5-A succussor of ID3
>Gini index 
>Decision Tree algorithms are referred to as CART(Classification and Regression Trees).
> calculate how much accuracy each split will cost us, using a function. 
The split that costs least is chosen
>recursive binary splitting:A greedy approach is used to divide the space
>Regression: The cost function that is minimized to choose split points is the sum squared 
error across all training samples that fall within the rectangle.
Classification: The Gini cost function is used which provides an 
indication of how pure the nodes are, where node purity refers to how
 mixed the training data assigned to each node is.
